This project uses R to analyze a large text from the gutenbergr library, focusing on:
  - Text Analysis: Word and bigram counts, chi-square tests, and entropy calculations.
  - Statistical Concepts: Hypothesis testing, confidence intervals, and entropy theory.
  - Classification: Applying Naive Bayes to classify sentences into text sections.
A blend of NLP techniques and statistical insights in R.
